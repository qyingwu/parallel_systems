# Course Projects Repository

Welcome to my Course Projects repository! This repository is primarily focused on demonstrating various projects and assignments completed as part of my academic coursework. These projects span different topics including software engineering, machine learning, GPU acceleration, and parallel systems, among others.

## About the Projects

Each project is designed to showcase a specific set of skills and techniques learned in my courses. The projects include:

## Technologies Used

The repository includes projects implemented in a variety of languages and technologies, including:

- **C++**: For parallel systems and low-level algorithm implementations.
- **CUDA**: For GPU acceleration in machine learning and data processing tasks.
- **Python**: For machine learning algorithms and data analysis.


## Disclaimer

These projects are part of my academic coursework and are for educational and demonstration purposes only. If you're working on similar coursework, I encourage you to use this repository as a reference but avoid copying the solutions directly.
I will be using zip file to include the source code since they are course projects and should not be directly searchable on internet.
